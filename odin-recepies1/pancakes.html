    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>For fluffier pancakes, let the batter rest for 5-10 minutes before cooking.</li>
        <li>Add chocolate chips or blueberries to the batter for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Keep cooked pancakes warm in a low oven while you finish cooking the rest.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different toppings like yogurt, honey, or nuts.</li>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>1. Can I make the batter ahead of time?</h3>
    <p>Yes, you can prepare the batter the night before and store it in the refrigerator. Just give it a gentle stir before cooking, as it may thicken overnight.</p>
    <h3>2. Can I freeze leftover pancakes?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! Let the pancakes cool completely, then stack them with parchment paper in between. Store in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 2 months. Reheat in the toaster or microwave when ready to eat.</p>
    <h3>3. What can I use instead of milk?</h3>
    <p>You can substitute milk with almond milk, soy milk, or any other non-dairy milk. You can also use water or yogurt for a different texture.</p>
    <h3>4. How can I make these pancakes healthier?</h3>
    <p>To make healthier pancakes, you can use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, reduce the sugar, or add mashed bananas or applesauce to the batter for natural sweetness. You can also top them with fresh fruit instead of syrup.</p>
